# Excel-Prioject-
I am excited to share with you the details of a recent Excel project that I have undertaken for study purposes. This project serves as a practical application of the concepts and skills acquired during my studies, providing a hands-on experience in data analysis and spreadsheet management.

The project titled 'Vrinda Store Report 2022' aimed to help the store create an annual sales report, analyze customer behavior and boost customer sales.
I performed various tasks such as data cleaning,processing,analysis, visualization and report creation.

The project also answered important questions such as :-
How do sales and orders compare using a single chart?
Which month had the highest sales and orders?
Who purchased more, men or women in 2022 ?
What are different order statuses in 2022?
Which are the top 5 states contributing to sales?
What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?

Based on the report insights,here are the outcomes of the sales :-
1 Women are more likely to purchase (65%) than men.
2 Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh were the top contributors to sales (35%).
3 The adult age group (30-49 yrs) made the most contributions(50%).
4 Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels were the top contributors(80%).
Conclusion-
The final conclusion to improve store sales is to target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon,Flipkart and Myntra.
